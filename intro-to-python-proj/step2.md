## Pre-existing code

First we will open the file `fin_gif.py` in the VSCode editor.

This file will be where we write our module.  Several functions and classes are provided for you.

If you like, you can look over them now and see if you can figure out what they do.

After you have perused the functions add the `import ...` statements to your script. You will need to import:

- `argparse`
- `os`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`
- `yfinance`
- `imageio`

and include these additional imports as well:

```
from sklearn.linear_model import SGDRegressor
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from texttable import Texttable
```
