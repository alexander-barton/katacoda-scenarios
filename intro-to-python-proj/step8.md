## Make gif

First we will need to write a function to make scatter plots:

`make_fig`

You'll want this function to take two numpy vectors to plot as scatters, as well as a coefficient and intercept to plot the fit line.

Make sure to return the matplotlib figure (the `make_fig` function will need it.)

The `make_gif` function is provided for you.
