## Working in Finance!

Welcome to part II of Intro to Python!  Our goal is to write a module that will take as inputs:

- the name of a ticker on the stock market
- the output name for a .gif file

and using these will:

- output descriptive statistics for the security (YTD)
- clean the data
- perform a regression on features of the data
- save the outputs of the regression to images
- turn these images into a gif

Good Luck!
